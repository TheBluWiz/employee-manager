  ## Description
  This Content Management System (CMS) allows for the creation and upkeep of department, role, and employee data via the command line. The information is stored in a database, but the CMS streamlines data access for non-developers.

  ## Installation
  The database must first be created using the schema file. From the projects directory, open mySQL and run 'SOURCE db/schema.sql'. Run 'npm i' from the command line to install dependencies. To start the program, run 'node index.js'.
  ## Usage
  Command line prompts ask for user input and then update the database.
  ## Walkthrough Video

  ## Moving Forward
  Additional features to come:
  - Update employee managers
  - View employees by manager
  - View employees by department
  - Delete departments, roles, and employees
  - View the total utilized budget of a department (the combined salaries of all employees of a department)

  If an company were to actually choose to implement this software, I would love to update it to include payroll information. There are many situational variables for this that differ state to state that would need to be considered prior to development though.
